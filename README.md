# REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING-BASED-CONTROL-FOR-MOTOR-AND-TANK-DYNAMICS
Project on RL-based control of DC motor speed and water level in a single-tank system using MATLAB. Includes system modeling, reward design, and RL implementation, compared with traditional control methods for stability, convergence, and performance evaluation.
